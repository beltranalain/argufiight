# Quick Start Guide

## Navigate to Project Directory

**IMPORTANT:** You must be in the project directory to run commands!

```powershell
cd C:\Users\beltr\Honorable.AI
```

## Then Run Commands

```powershell
# Install dependencies (if not already done)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000`

## Verify You're in the Right Directory

You should see these files when you run `ls` or `dir`:
- `package.json`
- `next.config.js`
- `tailwind.config.ts`
- `app/` folder
- `components/` folder

If you don't see these, you're in the wrong directory!
