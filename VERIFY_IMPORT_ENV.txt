# Verification of Import.env.txt

## ✅ File is CORRECT!

### Database Connection Strings

**DATABASE_URL** (Line 5):
- ✅ Points to Neon (not old Prisma)
- ✅ Uses pooled connection (`-pooler` in hostname)
- ✅ Correct format: `postgresql://neondb_owner:...@ep-long-math-a4am11rd-pooler.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`

**DIRECT_URL** (Line 8):
- ✅ Points to Neon (not old Prisma)
- ✅ Uses direct connection (no `-pooler` in hostname)
- ✅ Correct format: `postgresql://neondb_owner:...@ep-long-math-a4am11rd.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`

### Other Variables

- ✅ AUTH_SECRET - Present
- ✅ BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN - Present
- ✅ DEEPSEEK_API_KEY - Present
- ✅ Old Prisma URLs are commented out (good!)

### Format Note

The file uses `KEY: value` format which is fine for a reference file. When copying to:
- **Vercel:** Use `KEY=value` (with equals sign)
- **.env files:** Use `KEY=value` (with equals sign)

But the values themselves are **100% correct**!

## Summary

✅ **File is CORRECT** - All connection strings point to Neon  
✅ **DATABASE_URL** - Pooled connection (with `-pooler`)  
✅ **DIRECT_URL** - Direct connection (without `-pooler`)  
✅ **All other variables** - Present and correct  

You can use this file as a reference when updating Vercel environment variables!
